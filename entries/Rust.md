# Rust

---

- Rust is a multi-paradigm, general-purpose programming language. Rust emphasizes performance, type safety[wiki/type_safety], and concurrency. 
- Rust enforces memory safety—that is, that all references point to valid memory—without requiring the use of a garbage collector or reference counting present in other memory-safe languages.

- Rust grew out of a personal project begun in 2006 by Mozilla Research employee Graydon Hoare. Mozilla began sponsoring the project in 2009 as a part of the ongoing development of an experimental browser engine called Servo.
